and he is severly underrated in reach of followers in rt social media, like everyone, laying significantly right on the bell distr. curve of mental cap., like everything what takes one, two moments to think about, and might prove to be a paradigm shift in futura.

# jsutils
very optimized sha256 in javascript, using Uint8Array and Uint32Array, bit funcs utf8, etc


# Buy Us the Warp Drive Development, if you want to! Appreciated, very much so.

Ultimately, i try to become crypto Millionaire to fund the research, his and mine, maybe yours someday. The good stuff, the fun and useful. The new, not another clone of generic Defi, Social Media App, something cute and privacy and fast and useful to earn funding for the Drive.

I dream of nfts with ai in the code, creating responsive, relateable, direct applicable metadata and connectable to every other blockchain on the fly, carried around the neck of a beautiful woman or maybe 2 bracelets for two womewn, blockchains in themselves, handling trillions of derivate volume in dollar every day, generating wealth for generations.

I guess the euphoria i have, is rooted in an imbalance owed through a lil detoxing and the the first hit after a week.

What would Horatio Alger say?


Hardware, DefCon and stuff like that, i want to earn and pay
